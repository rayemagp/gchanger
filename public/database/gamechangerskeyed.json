The solar system has provided all the resources we could ever need, right here in our neighborhood. DSI will harvest, process and manufacture these resources, creating a reliable supply chain of products, fuel and building supplies in space.\n\nWhy are Asteroid Resources Important?\nDuring the formation of the Earth, as the planet cooled, heavy substances and important resources such as metals, sank to the inside of the planet.  This means that heavier elements, like metals, are rarely found in the Earthâ€™s crust.\nMost mining operations exist at the sites of ancient meteorite impacts.  Mines in Africa, Canada, Australia and elsewhere are currently extracting asteroid resources, deposited by devastating impacts in the distant past.\nScientists believe that the asteroid belt contains the remnants of a planet that existed between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.  For unknown reasons, this planet broke up into tiny pieces.  These planet pieces contain all the same things as the other rocky planets, but their resources are much easier to access since they are not trapped in the core of a planet.\n\nWhy Asteroid Mining?\nHuman expansion into the solar system has been severely limited by the expense and energy requirements of launching materials from Earth.  The availability of supplies and resources in space will fundamentally change the economics of space exploration and settlement.\nNear Earth Asteroids (NEAs) contain a wealth of useful materials such as water, metals and silicates.\nTo date, scientists and astronomers have discovered over 13,000 Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs).\nMany of these NEAs are energetically easier to reach than the Moon and are close enough to Earth that round-trip missions can be completed in as little as six months.\n\nFesibility?\nThe deep sea mining industry has pioneered robotic extraction methods that operate in harsh environments without human intervention.  Such systems are easily modified for use in space.\n",

Early published research on CRISPR/Cas9, coupled with a growing body of work on TALENs, suggests the potential to pursue therapeutic indications that have previously been intractable to traditional gene therapy, gene knock-down or other genome modification techniques. The CRISPR/Cas9 system, the most recent and exciting approach to emerge, acts by a mechanism in which the Cas9 protein binds to specific RNA molecules. The RNA molecules then guide the Cas9 complex to the exact location in the genome that requires repair. Similarly, TALENs are proteins that can be custom programmed to bind essentially any DNA sequence of interest and to direct gene modification activities to specific targets in the genome. CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs uniquely enable highly efficient knock-out, knock-down or selective editing of defective genes in the context of their natural promoters, unlocking the ability to treat the root cause of a broad range of diseases.

Harnessed here on earth, it would transform the worldâ€™s energy supply.  Fusion is clean, producing no pollution or greenhouse gas emissions, and fuel is abundant. Fusion is also safe: the process cannot runaway and produces no long-lived radioactive waste.\n\nHow Fusion Powers the Sun\nInside the sun's core, pressures are millions of times more than the surface of the earth, and the temperature reaches more than 15 million degrees C. Every second, this pressure and heat convert 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, releasing a tremendous amount of heat and energy.\n\nFusionâ€™s Fuel is Everywhere\nFusion energy is fueled by deuterium and tritium, isotopes which can be easily extracted from seawater and derived from lithium, in abundant supply.  There is enough to power the planet for hundreds of millions of years. The worldâ€™s seawater constitutes a 23 trillion-tonne reserve of deuterium, an isotope that is easily extracted. If fusion power plants were to generate all of todayâ€™s electricity, this seawater reserve would last over 65 billion years.

    "Description":"Hampton Creek is a food technology company headquartered in San Francisco focused on finding new ways of utilizing plants in food products.\n\nThe company aims to use technology to make healthier food without trans fats and MSG. Hampton Creek's data scientists are actively weeding out billions of proteins from hundreds of thousands of plants to learn what could form the equivalent of a chicken's egg. The company is seeking to create the largest plant database in the world.\n\nHampton Creekâ€™s value is in its multibillion-dollar opportunity to make the egg obsolete, replacing it with a plant-based formula that is cheaper, cholesterol-free and more humane\n\nEggs show up in all kinds of processed foods that we eat every day, like cookies, muffins, and mayonnaise. Whatâ€™s the big deal about mayo, you might ask? Mayonnaise is a staggering $18.5 billion industry (and the place where 12 percent of eggs end up). Balk would share tale after tale of conversations with egg procurers from major food conglomerates with Tetrick. â€œI get it,â€? theyâ€™d say, speaking about the cruelty and in-efficiency of our current egg supply, the risk of an Avian flu outbreak and its potential impact on the price of this necessary input, â€œbut cage-free is too expensive.â€?\n\nSo, the old friends started thinking â€“ what if all those processed foods didnâ€™t need eggs at all? Eggs provide many important properties to a product like the beloved chocolate chip cookie: structure, leavening, richness, color, and flavor. They contribute to thickening in sauces and mayo. These qualities make baked goods taste great. But, there are plant-based ingredients that have all of these properties, right? If they are cheaper to use, thereâ€™s a market opportunity there. As Balk puts it, â€œIf there were a plant-based egg product that had the same taste and texture as normal eggs, but it was less expensive, that would meet a need consumers and food customers have that hasnâ€™t been filled yet. Thatâ€™s a huge market opportunity.â€? The duo set out to find out exactly how big.\n\nBut the company sells itself on economics as much as on environmental stewardship. The ratio of energy input to food energy output for chicken-laid eggs is about 39-to-1, behind only beef and lamb farming. Hampton Creekâ€™s plant products maintain a ratio of 2-to-1. That translates into direct cost savings: Its egg equivalents cost 39 cents a poundâ€“almost half of its chicken-begat counterpart. As for the mayonnaise, the final product, mixed with lemon juice, vinegar and other ingredients, costs Whole Foods 10% less than regular mayo. ",

    "Description":"Impossible Foods is developing a new generation of delicious and sustainable meats and cheeses made entirely from plants. Our mission is to give people the enjoyment of food that comes from animals without the health and environmental drawbacks.\n\nWe look at animal products at the molecular level, then select specific proteins and nutrients from greens, seeds, and grains to recreate the wonderfully complex experience of meat and dairy products. For thousands of years weâ€™ve relied on animals to transform plants into meat, milk, cheese and eggs. Impossible Foods has found a better way to make the foods you love, directly from plants.\n\nWhat is Impossible Foods doing?\n\nImpossible Foods is making delicious meats and cheeses directly from simple plant ingredients. Our foods have the irresistibly delicious taste and texture of animal products, but no cholesterol, hormones, antibiotics, or slaughterhouse contaminants â€“ and require far less land, water and energy to produce.\n\nHow do you make your meats and cheeses?\n\nWe start with plants â€“ such as grains, greens and beans â€“ and separate proteins, fats, and other nutrients from each one, selecting those that give our foods desirable flavors and textures. We then combine these proteins with vitamins, amino acids, and fats, all from plants, to make our meats and cheeses.\n\nWhen will your first product be available?\n\nWe plan to introduce the Impossible burger â€” our first product â€” in 2016.\n\nWhere will I be able to purchase and eat an Impossible Burger?\n\nOur distribution plans for the first Impossible burgers are still in the worksâ€”but we will keep you posted. After we launch in the U.S., we plan to expand our production capacity and make the burgers as widely available as possible!\n\nHow is the Impossible Burger different from a veggie burger?\n\nVeggie burgers are great for those looking for an alternative to conventional meat, but not for true meat-lovers. We are creating uncompromising meats for people who love meat, directly from proteins and other ingredients found in plants. Our burgers will delight and satisfy meat lovers who are looking for the most delicious burger they can buy at the best value. We aim to deliver, without compromise, every pleasure that meat-lovers get from burgers â€“ from the visual appearance and versatility of the raw meat, to the smell and sizzle during cooking, to the ultimate taste and texture of the burger.\n\nWith all of our products, we aim to delight, nourish and satisfy everyone who loves to eat meat and dairy foods. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve devoted ourselves to creating meats and cheeses from plants that will be every bit as delicious as the best products made from animals.",
